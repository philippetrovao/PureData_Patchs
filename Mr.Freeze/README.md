MR. FREEZE ver. 1.0

Polifonic Freezer

Resources: rev3~ | cyclone library | else library

This poliphonic freezer allows you to freeze 16 voices with adsr for all or individual voice.
It also allows you to "unfreeze" all or a voice of your choice. The option "release/and clean" 
allows you to clean the voice upon unfreeze or keep it and use later. You can bringa back any
voice with "retrigger".
You can use the "sustain" fader to adjust the volume of all voices or the one of your choosing 
giving the patch a lot of options and dynamic. Everything else is very straighforward. 

The inlets list is the following:

1 - audio input
2 - freeze button
3 - unfreeze button
4 - retrigger button
5 - Volume (0-2)
6 - Attack (0-5000)
7 - Decay (0 - 3000)
8 - Sustain (0-1)
9 - Release (0-5000)

Thank you for checking out.
